Creating a mobile calculator using a Swift language with Storyboard

<p> In this application you can enter any subject you wish to study, entering this data: subject, number of days and number of hours. As data is entered you can follow the history through a list!

<h2> Development </h2>
<p> In this challenge I was able to put into practice my first knowledge in Swift language using the Storyboard. Using UIKit I was able to work with views, pickerview and tableview.
